**Things To Remember:** 

1. Be sure to merge into the right branch. The choices are:
* **`master`** if your PR runs on the current version of Tableau.
* **`dev-2021.2`**  
2. You should update at least one of the following:
* The changelog of the project you modified.
* The root `README.md` if the PR is a release of the SDK, Connector Packager, or TDVT.
