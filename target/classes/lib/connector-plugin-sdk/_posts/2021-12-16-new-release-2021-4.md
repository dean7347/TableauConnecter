title:  "Connector SDK now targets Tableau 2021.4"
abstract: "The master SDK branch now targets Tableau 2021.4. The Connector SDK for 2021.3 has released for those wishing to target that version."
---

On December 16, with the full release of Tableau 2021.4 we moved the latest version of the master branch to target Tableau 2021.4. This means that the samples and connectors made with this version of the SDK may not work with older versions of Tableau. To develop against Tableau 2021.3, please download the [Tableau Connector SDK for Tableau 2021.3](https://github.com/tableau/connector-plugin-sdk/releases/tag/tableau-2021.3) release.

__Full Hive Dialect Sample Released__
With the addition of new dialect customizations, we have updated our [Hive12Dialect.tdd sample](https://github.com/tableau/connector-plugin-sdk/blob/master/samples/components/dialects/Hive12Dialect.tdd) to no longer rely on an existing base dialect, and instead be fully defined in the .tdd file.
